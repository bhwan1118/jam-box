# Motivation and Project Idea

As music lovers, we know how much fun jamming with other people can be and because of this shared passion, we wanted to make a device that would help novice or intermediate players jam with their friends. Our solution is a device which remaps the white keys on a MIDI keyboard according to a key and scale selected by the user. We believe that this project will serve as inspiration for beginners to study music fruther, intermediate players to learn improvisation skills, and advanced players to experiment with using a variety of scales in a given key.

Overall, we want people of all skill levels to experience the joy of making music with others!

# Interaction plan

The user will rotate the rotary encoder and select the scale in which they want to play. There are two scenarios:

Alone: The user plays over a song that is being played, the user must know the key of the song that is playing so that this key can be selected on our device.

Jam with a friend: A friend tells the user in which key he/she is going to play so that the user can select the key on our device.

# Jambox in action

If you listen carefully you'll notice that everything she played sounded good even though she was randomly pressing the white keys
