# Motivation and Project Idea

We both love music and know how fun playing with other people can be, because of this, we wanted to make a device that would help novice or intermediate players jam with their friends, our solution is a device which maps the white keys on a keyboard according to a scale selected by the user. We also believe that this project could serve as inspiration for people to learn an instrument, as they would experience the feeling of making a good melody even if they haven't practiced or studied before.

# Interaction plan

The user will rotate the rotary encoder and select the scale in which they want to play. There are two scenarios:

Alone: The user plays over a song that is being played, the user must know the key of the song that is playing so that this key can be selected on our device.

Jam with a friend: A friend tells the user in which key he/she is going to play so that the user can select the key on our device.
